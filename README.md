## Preparation
Peel and cut potatos into ~1 inch cubes.  Wash and place to the side

Dice or chop onion and sautee with butter in bottom of pan until golden brown.

Add potatos and pour chicken stock. Bring to a boil stiring occasionally

When potatos are soft, add a big pinch of flour, entire sour cream container.

Garnish with cheese, onions, chives, hot sauce and S&P to taste.
